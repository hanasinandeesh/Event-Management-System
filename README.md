# Event-Management-System
A comprehensive Event Management System built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs. This project provides a robust platform for managing events with features for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting events. It includes a secure authentication system and a user-friendly dashboard to efficiently handle event management tasks.



The "Create Event" feature allows users to add new events by providing details such as title, description, date, location, and type. This functionality ensures that users can efficiently manage and organize events directly through the platform.
